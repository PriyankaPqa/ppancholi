The personal information (“PI”) that I submit in connection with my registration is being collected for the purposes of determining my eligibility for humanitarian services, authenticating my identity, providing humanitarian services to me and my household, communicating with me, and continually evaluating and improving humanitarian service delivery. Such PI will also be used for other purposes permitted by applicable law, including fraud detection and prevention, as well as for audit and reporting purposes and to investigate incidents and complaints.\n\n2. If I provide PI about any other individual, such as my household members, I have their consent or the authority to provide such information to the Canadian Red Cross (“CRC”) for the purposes described above.\n\n3. The PI that I provide to CRC may be shared with government authorities and credit agencies to confirm the accuracy of the information, to authenticate my identity and otherwise as required or permitted by law. Such PI may also be disclosed to government authorities for the purposes of facilitating my humanitarian assistance, avoiding service duplication, obtaining funding, for advocacy purposes, and for the purposes of complying with our contractual obligations. CRC may also disclose PI to other third parties, for the purposes of facilitating the coordination of services I have been approved to receive, with my consent. I understand and acknowledge that information disclosed to government authorities and other third parties ceases to be under the control of CRC, and that such PI will be handled in accordance with the laws and policies applicable to such third parties and may be used and disclosed by such third parties for their own purposes (which may differ from the purposes described above). I acknowledge that CRC is not responsible or liable for the acts or omissions of government authorities or other third parties that are not acting as agents or service providers to CRC. \n\n4. The PI that I provide to CRC may be disclosed to service providers for the purpose of facilitating the assistance I am approved to receive, providing client support, and for quality improvement purposes. Such service providers may include call centers, accommodation and transportation providers, and CRC will share with such third parties the information I provide in connection with my registration. CRC’s general practice is to store PI in Canada; however some service providers may access or store my PI outside of Canada.  Information that is transferred or stored outside Canada may be accessible to courts, law enforcement and national authorities in other countries. I understand that I may contact CRC’s Privacy Officer, as described below, with any questions about the collection, use, disclosure or storage of personal information by its service providers outside Canada or to obtain written information about its policies and practices with respect to service providers outside Canada.\n\n5. My PI will be stored securely in CRC’s databases and accessible to Emergency Management and Recovery Services teams, select Corporate Services, Communications, and\/or Information Management personnel who require such access to perform their duties or services.  My PI will be kept as long as it is necessary for service provision or to meet CRC’s legal obligations. I agree that CRC may retain my PI in its database, and combine such PI with other information provided by me (whether before or after the date of my current registration for humanitarian services), for the purposes of maintaining the continuity of my relationship with CRC and allowing me to efficiently apply for other services or support provided or administered by CRC.  \n\n6. My PI may be used and disclosed, in a form that does not allow me to be identified, for research, advocacy and\/or quality improvement purposes (e.g., for service improvement and to better understand the needs of persons affected by emergencies).\n\n7. I can ask to access, correct \/ rectify or update my PI, opt-out of my information being used for any non-essential purpose(s), withdraw my consent to continued collection, use, retention or disclosure of my PI (subject to legal and contractual restrictions), or ask questions about collection of my PI, by contacting CRC’s Privacy Officer at {email}.
